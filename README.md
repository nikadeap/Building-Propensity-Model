VMWare store has an online portal where users can purchase certain products such as Fusion and Workstation and the later is the important driver of revenue generation. Major source of revenue comes from renewal via upgrade to the latest software but this year no upgrade is planned for workstation.
The business challenge is to target new workstation customers, up-sell to existing customers who have not upgraded to the available latest version and cross sell to the customers who donâ€™t have workstation.To increase the sale, VMWare would target potential customer who are likely to buy by offering them coupons.
Now looking at the problem from analytics angle, VMWare has rich source of information about the customers including their purchase history and email ids. As the customer base is already high, it is not advisable to send the coupons straightaway to all the customers due to budget constraints.
Now using analytics and  machine learning techniques, analytics team can build a propensity model to identify the customer who are likely to buy. Lift/Gain chart could help in identifying the targeted audience
